# Go for Operations Workshop

Demo repository for my "Go for Operations" workshop.

Use the right tool (and language) for the job! This is the motto for this hands-on
session. Go is a popular modern, simple, reliable and efficient programming language
especially in the Ops and Cloud-native domain. Docker, Kubernetes, Kubectl and many
other known tools and infrastructure components are all implemented in Go.

## Challenges:

1) [Challenge 0 - Setup the environment](./challenge-0/challenge-0.md)
2) [Challenge 1 - Command line dev tools](./challenge-1/challenge-1.md)
